## Interactive Features

* Mouseover Effect: when the user hovers over a dot in the line chart, a horizontal bar chart showing the earthquake counts for each state in the selected region and year will be shown beneath it, and the dot in the line chart will be enlarged to indicate that it is selected. Each bar in the bar chart represents the count of earthquakes for a given state in that region and year.
* Mouseout Effect: when the user mouse out the previously selected dot, the previously shown horizontal bar chart will be disappeared, and the dot will be reduced to its normal size.
